End-of-Life Notice
------------------
This project is no longer officially supported or maintained.  It is recommended everyone upgrade to Cerb5 to take advantage of the far more efficient and flexible PHP/PECL-based email parsing using ext/mailparse.

What's this?
------------
This is the source code to the command-line email parser that was used by Cerb2 and Cerb3.  This is deprecated code that is no longer officially supported.  We're open sourcing this code so that clients who still depend on these old versions of the project can make necessary changes (such as IPv6 support).

Installation
------------
* (TBD)
